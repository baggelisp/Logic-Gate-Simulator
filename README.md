Logic Gate Simulator

Investigate the behaviour of AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR and XOR gates.


For each of the logic gates you choose input from "on/off" switch andyou see the outputs for each gate.


NOT gate
The NOT gate is also known as an inverter because the output is the exact opposite of the input.

Input	Output
0		1
1		0


AND Gate
The AND gate has two inputs and one output.

Input 1	Input 2	Output
0		0		0
1		0		0
0		1		0
1		1		1


NAND gate
The NAND gate behaves in the opposite fashion to and AND gate. 

Input 1	Input 2	Output
0		0		1
1		0		1
0		1		1
1		1		0


OR gate
The OR gate has two inputs and one output.

Input 1	Input 2	Output
0		0		0
1		0		1
0		1		1
1		1		1


NOR gate
Just as the NAND gate could be thought of as an AND followed by a NOT

Input 1	Input 2	Output
0		0		1
1		0		0
0		1		0
1		1		0


XOR gate	

Input 1	Input 2	Output
0		0		0
1		0		1
0		1		1
1		1		0
